Logical condition in while loop:
The condition !cin.get(name, 30) || cin.gcount() != 0 is problematic. cin.get(name, 30) will return cin, which can be used as a boolean in the context of an if or while statement, but the cin.gcount() != 0 part is always true after a successful read, making the condition incorrect for detecting empty lines.

Handling cin.get():
In the nested while loop, cin.get() != '\n' is meant to skip until the next newline character. This can work, but it's a bit cumbersome and not entirely necessary if you handle the input correctly with cin.ignore().

Correct logic for detecting and handling empty input:
You want to check if the input is an empty line (which would set the fail bit due to reaching the end of the input without reading anything) and handle it properly.
